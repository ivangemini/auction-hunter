# Roadmap

## P0 — Vertical slice
- [x] Project architecture.
- [x] Yandex SDK bootstrap and Game Ready hook.
- [x] Data-driven items and lot templates.
- [x] NPC auction bidding.
- [x] Sequential item reveal.
- [x] Appraise + sell/keep decision.
- [x] Local bankroll and collection persistence.
- [x] Real art direction and first asset pack.
- [ ] Device/browser QA — automated gates are present; final Yandex draft + real-device pass remains manual.

## P1 — Retention-ready MVP
- [x] Restoration mini-game.
- [x] Item condition and restoration value uplift.
- [x] Collection book and set completion rewards.
- [x] Reputation XP and three auction tiers.
- [x] Daily special auction.
- [x] First-session onboarding and 30-minute progression curve.
- [x] Event analytics schema.
- [x] Yandex cloud save.
- [x] Clue-backed lot generation: visible clues correspond to real hidden categories/items.
- [x] Auction risk rebalance so forcing every win is not safely optimal.
- [x] Anti-soft-lock collection resale.
- [x] One strategic restoration attempt per won lot.
- [x] Landscape-first mobile guard and expanded touch hit areas.
- [x] Lightweight sound/game-feel feedback without external audio dependencies.
- [x] Round summary values kept inventory and rewarded ads no longer penalize collecting.

## P2 — Monetization and release
- [x] Rewarded ad placements based on optional value.
- [x] Interstitial policy at natural breaks.
- [x] Sound/focus/ad pause handling.
- [ ] Store/IAP design if metrics justify it — intentionally gated on post-release telemetry; see `IAP_GATE.md`.
- [x] Full RU/EN localization.
- [x] Yandex moderation checklist and archive build pipeline.
- [ ] Retention/economy tuning from real telemetry — requires released traffic.

## P3 — v1.0 depth
- [x] Daily contracts.
- [x] Achievement milestones.
- [x] Business Office hub and three cash-funded upgrade paths.
- [x] Lifetime statistics dashboard.
- [x] Recent auction history with cloud-persisted outcomes.
- [x] Bidder personality tells/reactions.
- [x] Rare lot modifiers/events.
- [x] Paid late-game advanced inspection that preserves hidden exact value.
- [x] Expanded catalog: 18 lot templates, 24 items and 8 collection sets.
- [x] Economy strategy simulation regression gate.
- [x] Accessibility settings for sound feedback, reduced motion and higher contrast.
- [x] Replayability/content-scale regression floor and moderation evidence document.
- [x] Second art/content pass: direct art for all 24 items and 9 lot environments.
- [ ] Timed 10+ minute Yandex draft content-duration check.
- [ ] Real Yandex draft/device QA and first telemetry-driven tuning pass.
