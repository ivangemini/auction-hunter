# Roadmap

## P0 — Vertical slice
- [x] Project architecture.
- [x] Yandex SDK bootstrap and Game Ready hook.
- [x] Data-driven items and lot templates.
- [x] NPC auction bidding.
- [x] Sequential item reveal.
- [x] Appraise + sell/keep decision.
- [x] Local bankroll and collection persistence.
- [x] Real art direction and first asset pack.
- [ ] Device/browser QA — automated gates are present; final Yandex draft + real-device pass remains manual.

## P1 — Retention-ready MVP
- [x] Restoration mini-game.
- [x] Item condition and restoration value uplift.
- [x] Collection book and set completion rewards.
- [x] Reputation XP and three auction tiers.
- [x] Daily special auction.
- [x] First-session onboarding and 30-minute progression curve.
- [x] Event analytics schema.
- [x] Yandex cloud save.
- [x] Clue-backed lot generation: visible clues correspond to real hidden categories/items.
- [x] Auction risk rebalance so forcing every win is not safely optimal.
- [x] Anti-soft-lock collection resale.
- [x] One strategic restoration attempt per won lot.
- [x] Landscape-first mobile guard and expanded touch hit areas.
- [x] Lightweight sound/game-feel feedback without external audio dependencies.
- [x] Round summary values kept inventory and rewarded ads no longer penalize collecting.

## P2 — Monetization and release
- [x] Rewarded ad placements based on optional value.
- [x] Interstitial policy at natural breaks.
- [x] API-controlled sticky banner outside active gameplay.
- [x] Sound/focus/ad pause handling.
- [ ] Store/IAP design if metrics justify it — intentionally gated on post-release telemetry; see `IAP_GATE.md`.
- [x] Full RU/EN localization.
- [x] Yandex moderation checklist and archive build pipeline.
- [ ] Retention/economy tuning from real telemetry — requires released traffic.

## P3 — v1.0 depth
- [x] Daily contracts.
- [x] Achievement milestones.
- [x] Business Office hub and three cash-funded upgrade paths.
- [x] Lifetime statistics dashboard.
- [x] Recent auction history with cloud-persisted outcomes.
- [x] Bidder personality tells/reactions.
- [x] Rare lot modifiers/events.
- [x] Paid late-game advanced inspection that preserves hidden exact value.
- [x] Initial expanded catalog: 18 lot templates, 24 items and 8 collection sets.
- [x] Economy strategy simulation regression gate.
- [x] Accessibility settings for sound feedback, reduced motion and higher contrast.
- [x] Replayability/content-scale regression floor and moderation evidence document.
- [x] Second art/content pass: direct art for all initial 24 items and 9 lot environments.
- [ ] Timed 10+ minute Yandex draft content-duration check.
- [ ] Real Yandex draft/device QA and first telemetry-driven tuning pass.

## P4 — v1.1 decision depth
- [x] Three distinct normal-auction lot options before each auction.
- [x] Selection cards expose opening price, item count, truthful clues and visible rare modifiers without revealing hidden value.
- [x] Dealer Memory summarizes recent personal normal-auction outcomes for the same lot template without inspecting current hidden state.
- [x] Daily Special remains a fixed featured lot and bypasses normal selection after activation.
- [x] Lot-selection funnel analytics and Metrica goal coverage.
- [x] One lot-options impression per tier per page-session market cycle, with shared cycle context on presentation and selection events.
- [x] Browser/Yandex contract and production screenshot automation updated for selection -> lobby -> auction.
- [ ] Tune option mix/modifier frequency from post-launch choice and retention telemetry before promoting v1.1 to a release candidate.

## P5 — content breadth
- [x] First breadth pack: 36 item identities with direct art.
- [x] Expand normal-auction catalog to 24 templates / 8 per tier without changing tier unlock pacing.
- [x] Expand Collection Book to 12 sets while preserving existing set IDs/rewards and save compatibility.
- [x] Keep all new lot clues truthful and all new items represented in at least one collection set.
- [x] Raise automated content/replayability floors to the expanded catalog.
- [ ] Run economy simulation and browser/release CI against the expanded pack plus Buyer Market/per-copy traits.
- [ ] During/after first moderation, continue breadth toward roughly 72 items / 42 lots / 24 sets rather than stopping development at the first submitted build.

## P6 — retention and trading depth
- [x] Stable collectible traits/provenance tags for selected item identities.
- [x] Daily Buyer Market with two category buyers and one specialist buyer.
- [x] One premium sale per buyer offer per local day with cloud-persisted claim state.
- [x] Buyer sales feed cash, lifetime sales, daily contracts and typed analytics/Metrica.
- [x] Collection Book exposes market traits and a direct Buyer Market entry point.
- [x] Per-copy randomized positive/negative traits with appraisal multipliers.
- [x] Inventory-instance persistence retains each copy's appraisal, condition, restoration and traits while preserving the legacy ID index for sets/save compatibility.
- [x] Buyer Market prices and removes the exact concrete copy; Collection quick-sale intentionally sells the lowest-value duplicate first.
- [x] Decompose `AuctionScene.ts` before adding another major reveal/trading mechanic directly to it — lot-market preparation/cache and restoration interaction now live in dedicated game modules.
- [x] Deeper restoration choices with distinct safe/pro/risky paths.
- [ ] Persistent rival-dealer specialties and learned behavior.
- [ ] Collection-set perks that unlock lasting expertise rather than only cash rewards.
- [ ] Legendary multi-auction discovery chains.
